This paper describes the three principal phases of the System R project and discusses some of the lessons learned from System R about the design of relational systems and database systems in general.\n\n\n%% Import Date: 2022-12-25T20:04:54.478-06:00 %%\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-26T05:16:26.33792771Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Metastability":{"title":"Metastability","content":"\nPaper notes at [[technical/papers/Metastable Failures in Distributed Systems]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-26T05:16:26.33792771Z","tags":null}}
